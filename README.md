# Melody

This project is a fork of the latest version of [olahol/melody](https://github.com/olahol/melody) that continues its development independently.

> :notes: Minimalist websocket framework for Fasthttp.

Melody is websocket framework based on [github.com/fasthttp/websocket](https://github.com/fasthttp/websocket)
that abstracts away the tedious parts of handling websockets. It gets out of
your way so you can write real-time apps. Features include:

* [x] Clear and easy interface similar to `net/http` or Gin.
* [x] A simple way to broadcast to all or selected connected sessions.
* [x] Message buffers making concurrent writing safe.
* [x] Automatic handling of sending ping/pong heartbeats that timeout broken sessions.
* [x] Store data on sessions.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/yafengio/melody
```


```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/yafengio/melody"
)

func main() {
	m := melody.New()

	m.HandleMessage(func(s *melody.Session, msg []byte) {
		s.Write(msg)
	})

	handler := func(ctx *fasthttp.RequestCtx) {
		m.HandleRequest(ctx)
	}

	fasthttp.ListenAndServe(":5000", handler)
}
```
